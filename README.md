# Sphinx Cairo DB Simulator

Sphinx Cairo DB Simulator is a tool that leverages the Cairo language to generate provable traces, demonstrated by the SHARP proof system. It further validates these traces using the Stone verifier program. The simulator retrieves the initial state of a database, simulates a series of queries, captures the final state, and ensures equality between the initial and final states. This process substantiates the actual execution of queries and generates proof of queries (PoQ).
